# AG Hierarchy Builder: Quick Start Guide

## What is it?

The AG Hierarchy Builder helps retail professionals create logical product groupings (Assortment Groups or AGs) based on shared attributes like brand, color, and style. It visualizes product distribution across these groups and recommends optimal attribute combinations.

## Key Benefits

- **Balanced Assortments**: Create well-distributed product groups
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Get suggestions for optimal attribute combinations
- **Price Analysis**: Identify inconsistent pricing within groups
- **Multi-level Hierarchies**: Build nested product categorizations
- **Visual Insights**: Understand your product catalog structure

## 4-Step Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Product Catalog
- Upload a CSV file with your product data
- Required columns: `product_id` + attribute columns
- Optional: `price` column for price variance analysis

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Review Attribute Analysis
- See distribution statistics for each attribute
- Higher number of unique values generally means better differentiation
- Visualizations help identify well-distributed attributes

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Select Attribute Combinations
- **Manual**: Create your own attribute combinations
- **Recommended**: Set filters and let the system suggest options
- Look for attribute combinations with scores of 2-3 (on 1-3 scale)
- Click the graph icon (üìä) to preview results for any combination

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze Results
- Review product distribution across groups
- Check price variance within groups
- Compare different attribute combinations using tabs
- Select the combination that creates the most logical groupings

## Tips for Success

- Clean your data before uploading
- Start with 2-3 attributes before trying more complex combinations
- Look for balanced distribution (avoid having too many or too few products in groups)
- Consider price variance (lower variance typically means more coherent groups)
- Use the scoring system as a starting point for evaluation
